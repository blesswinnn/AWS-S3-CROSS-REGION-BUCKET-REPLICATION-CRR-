# AWS-S3-CROSS-REGION-BUCKET-REPLICATION-CRR

## üöÄ Overview

This project demonstrates how to **replicate objects from one S3 bucket to another across AWS regions** using **S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**. It's essential for:
- Disaster recovery
- Data locality compliance
- Reduced latency for global users
- Backup and resilience strategies

# üß† Key Concepts
## ‚úÖ What is S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)?
  - S3 CRR allows automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across S3 buckets in different AWS regions. This is useful when you want to:
  - Keep backups in another region
  - Serve content faster to users globally

## üîê Prerequisites
- Source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled
- IAM roles and policies must allow s3:ReplicateObject, s3:ReplicateDelete, etc.
- KMS keys should be used if encryption is enabled

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
- Create source and destination buckets in different AWS regions
- Enable versioning on both buckets
- Define a replication rule on the source bucket
- Create an IAM role that S3 uses to replicate objects
- Upload an object to the source bucket and observe it being replicated
- Optional: Use KMS for encryption and advanced bucket policies for fine-grained control.

# üåê Architecture

- Region A: Source Bucket

- Region B: Destination Bucket

- IAM Role with replication permissions

- Optional: CloudWatch for monitoring

# üìå Features
- ‚úÖ Auto-provisioned IAM Role for replication

- ‚úÖ Cross-region support with customizable regions

- ‚úÖ KMS encryption support
